= AsciiDoc Book Library

I often go into projects with a need to create a documentation library, since I tend to write everything in asciidoc I felt a need to make it easier for me to present it to whoever needs it.

There will be multiple ways to use this repository:
  - Static HTML-files generated by a shell-script
  - PHP-file that works in a similar fashion if PHP is available

The PHP-file is more dynamic where the HTML does not require anything but a webserver.

== How it works

Simply create a directory in the top-level root directory where the shell-script resides. This will be your category.

In that directory, you can add one or multiple "books" in separate directories while will be linked in and presented in the top level index-file.
